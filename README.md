Overview
---

This project illustrates how deep learning can be used to clone driving behavior to guide Self-Driving cars as part of Project#4 of Udacity Self-Driving Nanodegree.
This repository contains necessary files for running Behavioral Cloning Project.

Details about implementation, background and theory is available in the PDF(Project4_behavioral_cloning.pdf) or at the link here (https://medium.com/@madhusudhan.d/guiding-self-driving-car-using-behavioral-cloning-9c24541a425d)

The Project
---
The main implementation steps of this project are the following:
* Used the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Designed, trained and validated a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Used the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track without leaving its boundaries in the simulator. 
* Summarized the results with a written report

### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab enviroment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

The following resources can be found in this github repository:
* drive.py
* video.py
* model.py
* model.h5
* Project4_behavioral_cloning.pdf


##Running the model

### `drive.py`

Usage of `drive.py` requires you have saved the trained model as an h5 file, i.e. `model.h5`. See the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model) for how to create this file using the following command:
```sh
model.save(filepath)
```

Once the model has been saved, it can be used with drive.py using this command:

```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

The above command will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.

Note: There is known local system's setting issue with replacing "," with "." when using drive.py. When this happens it can make predicted steering values clipped to max/min values. If this occurs, a known fix for this is to add "export LANG=en_US.utf8" to the bashrc file.

#### Saving a video of the autonomous agent

```sh
python drive.py model.h5 run1
```

The fourth argument, `run1`, is the directory in which to save the images seen by the agent. If the directory already exists, it'll be overwritten.

```sh
ls run1

The image file name is a timestamp of when the image was seen. This information is used by `video.py` to create a chronological video of the agent driving.

### `video.py`

```sh
python video.py run1
```

Creates a video based on images found in the `run1` directory. The name of the video will be the name of the directory followed by `'.mp4'`, so, in this case the video will be `run1.mp4`.

Optionally, one can specify the FPS (frames per second) of the video:

```sh
python video.py run1 --fps 48
```

Will run the video at 48 FPS. The default FPS is 60.
